# Set up your development environment
## Prerequisites

Ensure your machine meets the following requirements before heading over to the [Agents 101 ‚ÜóÔ∏è](/guides/agent-courses/introductory-course) and [Agents 101 for AI Engine ‚ÜóÔ∏è](/guides/agent-courses/agents-for-ai) courses:

    1. **Python 3.8+**: download and install Python from [Python's official website ‚ÜóÔ∏è](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
    2. **Preferred IDE**: Visual Studio Code or PyCharm (alternative options like Notepad are feasible).

## Set up development tools
### Installing Homebrew

**Homebrew** streamlines software installations on MacOS via the command line. To install and update Homebrew, execute the following commands:

    ```
    /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
    ```

You can verify it [here ‚ÜóÔ∏è](https://brew.sh/). Let's then ensure Homebrew is updated:

    ```
    brew update
    ```

      For more information on Homebrew explore their [website ‚ÜóÔ∏è](https://brew.sh/).
    </Callout>

### Installing PyEnv

Now, you need to install **PyEnv**. It is a simple tool to manage multiple versions of Python. Run:

    ```
    brew install pyenv
    ```

Once you have installed PyEnv you can configure the shell environment:

    ```
    echo 'export PYENV_ROOT="$HOME/.pyenv"' >> ~/.zshrc
    echo 'command -v pyenv >/dev/null || export PATH="$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
    echo 'eval "$(pyenv init -)"' >> ~/.zshrc
    ```

    <Callout type="info" emoji="‚ÑπÔ∏è">
      These commands configure your shell environment (specifically the **Zsh shell**) to work with PyEnv. These commands set up environment variables, modify the PATH, and initialize PyEnv so that you can easily manage and switch between different Python versions. You can verify all steps [here ‚ÜóÔ∏è](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv#installation).
    </Callout>

You are now ready to **install Python** if you haven't done it yet. You need to install a version of Python 3.8 or above (for this example, we use version 3.10):

    ```
    pyenv install 3.10
    ```

You can get help or check a command insights by running:

    ```
    pyenv help
    ```

Let's now ensure the **global version of Python** you are working with is not the default one in the system. Run:

    ```
    pyenv global 3.10 # this sets the global interpreter
    pyenv versions # this verifies if it is set up correctly
    ```

### Installing Poetry

You now need to install **Poetry**. Poetry is used for managing Python project dependencies, handling virtual environments, packaging, and publishing Python libraries or applications.

You can install Poetry by running the following command:

    ```
    curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
    ```

    <Callout type="info" emoji="‚ÑπÔ∏è">
      If you would like to learn more about Poetry, visit the [website ‚ÜóÔ∏è](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation) for further information.
    </Callout>

### Initialize your project with Poetry

You now have all necessary tools installed. You are ready to initialize your project! Let's create a working directory and initialize Poetry üéâ.

First, you need to create a working directory for your project using `mkdir` command. Then, you will need to change directory to this one, using `cd` command:

    ```
    mkdir development/agent-demo
    cd development/agent-demo
    ```

You can ensure you are in the correct directory by checking your current path:

    ```
    pwd
    # Example output: /Users/Jessica/Documents
    ```

If you are happy with the install location for the project, go ahead and **initialize Poetry**:

    ```
    poetry init
    ```

    <Callout type="info" emoji="‚ÑπÔ∏è">
      Follow the setup wizard to provide details including project name, version, author, license, and select dependencies (e.g., `uagents`).
    </Callout>

Once you complete the initialization, run:

    ```
    poetry install
    ```

This command will install the dependencies specified in the **pyproject.toml** file.

**Congratulations! You've completed the installation process. You're now all set to embark on creating your first Agent!**

Head over to the [Agents 101 ‚ÜóÔ∏è](/guides/agent-courses/introductory-course) to get started!
